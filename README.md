## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a robust image classification system capable of accurately identifying and categorizing images into predefined classes. The system leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and classification tasks.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **model/**: Contains the Jupyter notebook for training the CNN model and the saved model weights.
- **server/**: Houses the Flask application that serves the model for inference.
- **UI/**: Includes the frontend components for user interaction.
- **README.md**: Provides an overview and documentation of the project.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AhmedAyman77/Image_Classification.git
   cd Image_Classification
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *Note: Ensure that `requirements.txt` is present in the root directory with all necessary dependencies listed.*

## Usage

### Training the Model

1. **Navigate to the model directory:**

   ```bash
   cd model
   ```

2. **Open and run the Jupyter notebook:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook train_model.ipynb
   ```

   This notebook guides you through the steps of data preprocessing, model architecture definition, training, and saving the model weights.

### Running the Web Application

1. **Navigate to the server directory:**

   ```bash
   cd ../server
   ```

2. **Start the Flask application:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. **Access the application:**

   Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to interact with the image classification interface.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model is designed with the following layers:

- Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
- MaxPooling layers for downsampling
- Fully connected (Dense) layers
- Dropout layers to prevent overfitting
- Softmax output layer for classification

The model is compiled with categorical crossentropy loss and the Adam optimizer.

## Deployment

The application is deployed locally using Flask. For production deployment, consider using platforms like Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, or Docker containers for scalability and robustness.
